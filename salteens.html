	  <p class="dark" style="width:35%">The Salteens are a Canadian independant pop/rock band. They've been around since 1997. I'm telling you it's a great year. They were on an episode of "Yo Gabba Gabba!" in 2007, which I thought was interesting. I won't regurgitate the whole wikipedia article, but all I'll say is that I really like a lot of this band's songs.</p>
