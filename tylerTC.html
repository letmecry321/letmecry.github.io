			  <p>Tyler, The Creator (Tyler Okonma) - Musician, songwriter, actor, and producer to sum him up in 4 words. Born on March 6, 1991, in Hawthorne California. Taught himself piano at 14 and in the 2000s he co-founded Odd Future with Hodgy (rapper and producer, you’ll find him featured in many songs). His first albums were defined by critics as horrorcore, which he rejected profusely in his content. To define his music in my own words I would say it’s a mix of hip-hop, soul, and funk. Every album is a different genre in my opinion, I would say he has evolved a lot in his career.</p>
