	  <br>
		<p>Since sick animation is mostly joke songs, i don't really wanna waste my time reviewing full albums. Instead I'm choosing a few of my favorite songs to review.</p>
		<h3>When I Lay You Down</h3>
		  <p>The Gorillionaires are back with one more studio album before they retire y'all. It's a super catchy song that I now know all of the words to after listening to it for so long. Every verse is really well written, as expected from Marc M. I have to say third verse is so good and definitely the best. 10/10</p>
		  <h3>Summer Rain</h3>
		  <p>A cute song about meeting a girl. It sounds like a nice acoustic love song at first but once you listen to the actual words it changes completely into Marc's raunchy style that I find very entertaining. 9/10</p>
	  	<h3>Skating Boards</h3>
		  <p>This one's from his most recent album, and I like it quite a bit. Reminds me of my fond memories of doing skating boards with my best friends 8/10</p>
