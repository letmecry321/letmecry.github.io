			<h2>Discography : 8/10</h2>
	   <br>
	   <dl>
	    <dt><strong>New Jello : 8/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd>Like much of the album this song is very atmospheric, it's about 7:45 minutes long which is much longer than what you'd expect for a song of this nature, but it works well. Slow build up is a very prevalent feature of many of these songs, proof emo doesn't need lyrics.</dd>
	   <br>
	    <dt><strong>Sifelaver : 9/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd>The flow of this song is the best of the album, you can feel every chord, wave of the melody, and the tension in the pauses. Also a great use of screaming, it's incorporated in a way that takes nothing away of the great instrumental.</dd>
	   <br>
	    <dt><strong>What's The Matter River : 10/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd>This song is stressful. Intentionally so, the build up is so tenuous, and the screaming is so relieving. It's hard to state just how well the vocals are included in these tracks, they arn't overwhelming or obnoxious, like certain bands, but the still have draw and potency.</dd>
	   <br> 
	    <dt><strong>Coughin' : 8/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd>This song is just a jam. The drums are definitetly a standout here. And yet again great use of pauses.</dd>
	   <br> 
	    <dt><strong>Shoot Hypotenuse : 6/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd>I don't know what it is, but this song just isn't really up to par with the previous ones. The bass is wonky and the drums dont coordinate as well. I really can't tell.</dd>
	   <br> 
	    <dt><strong>Bluestone : 7/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd>Not necessarily a standout but its still pretty enjoyable. Just recording me's enough.</dd>
     <br>
	    <dt><strong>Pretty Fix : 4.5/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd>I dont know if im just tired, but when listening to write this review the constant noise just hurt my head. There isn't enought rest in this song, i just ended up tuning it out.</dd>
	   <br>
	    <dt><strong>Sparcly : 9/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd>Yet another just great song. The song has a great balance of everything. It has all the qualities that make all the other songs great. Both the guitar and the screaming stand out here.</dd>
	   <br>
	    <dt><strong>Right Right Left : 6/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd>I know I have complimented the length of other songs, but this song is long and just kinda boring. There is really just a guitar playing the same two chords for most of the song. Its not real bad or anything and the more high energy and complex parts are great, its just a slog.</dd>
	   <br>
	    <dt><strong>Cowboy Syndrome : 10/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd>Conversely to its immediate predecessor, this song is straight to action. I rather enjoy this song. Its a pretty constant flow, but it has a really good one, and it is just the perfect legnth for it. Best use of screaming on the album imo</dd>
	   <br>
	    <dt><strong>Itt : 7/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd>Very traditional hardcore kinda shit. Short, loud, illegible, its got everything. Those aren't really complaints, but it is basic.</dd>
	   <br>
	    <dt><strong>Anacin : 7.5/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd>Its got the rhythm and progression of an earlier emocore song but it lacks the lyrics. Sounds like something i'd hear from Dag Nasty minus the vocals. I don't mind it but I was there was some more to it. I wish the guitar would pop more here too, it would be better if it was a little brighter.</dd>
	   <br>
	    <dt><strong>Last Name : 6/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd>I, for whatever reason, cannot care about this song. The buzz is annoying, other than that is pretty on par with the rest, but it just doesn't feel the same.</dd>
	   <br>
	    <dt><strong>Balance : It-would-be-unfair-to-rate/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd>A woman is talking to death... Ok to be fair this song owes a lot to the poem it recites. But the music makes is so impactful. This is just such a good poem, mixed with one of the best intrumentals and it just is so so good. It is not a song you can listen to often but it is so incredibaly unique compared not only to the rest of the discogrphy but pretty much any other song i've heard. Nothing can compare to listening to this song when taking a lonley night walk.</dd> 
	   <br>
	    <dt><strong>One Gallon Alda : 6/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd>man i dont know, it just kinda bored me. not diverse enough, hollow feeling i spose</dd> 
	   <br>
	    <dt><strong>Chuck : 5/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd>The only song in the discography where the screaming is reductive. also fast and long isn't a good combination, at least for this song</dd> 
	   </dl>  
	   <br>
	   <p>there are so many amazing songs on this album. no song has ever impacted me like balance. but there are alot of duds too which is just really unfortunate, but i still love this album and i dont think thats gonna change</p>
