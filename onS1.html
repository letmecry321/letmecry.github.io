			<p>This will not be a special writing I warn you now, only read my words if nothing else could possibly preoccupy your mind.</p>
			<br>
			<p>I have an old Nat King Cole record 'Nat "King" Cole Sings for Two in Love' and it crackles and pops when it plays, like a record for people in love should. It still got sold though, at least it was to my girlfriend and I.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Sometimes when I forget myself I wonder how people can live so ignorantly, and so full of passion for things that could be solved with some thought and a little decency. I then catch myself acting the same as soon leave head.
			Many things seem obvious to me and I can't help but think they should be obvious to everyone, but clearly if they are obvious then msot choose to ignore it, and its hard to go about inquiring about such thing "Hey have you thought about 
			this, is it obvious to you? No? Oh nevermind then." Either way at the end of that conversation someone feels like an idiot. I don't understand the hatred of being wrong, to the point where it makes you angry to be corrected or challenged.
			This isn't to say I am not that way, I'm fallible in that regard, but it is completly irrational.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Maybe on of the most depressing facts in contrast to the already bleak reality of exsistance is that truth doesn't matter. No argument has ever been won on the basis of objetivity. Many things can make your efforts feel futile but maybe none
			as much of this, in my opion of course (just remember that my opionion is the only correct one, obviously, nazi).</p>
			<br>
			<p> If there is any true way to be happy I think it must be the path absurdism. Absurdism and hedonism are truley not that different, however my thought is that while a hedonist satisfies the body with gluttony, the absudist satisfies the 
			mind with, from an outside view, irrational glee. I fancy myself to be an absurdist, I like to believe I already have some attributes. For example my writing this has brought me much joy and satisfaction just at the though of someone stumbling upon this and
			read it even though I prevously warned against it. While I know that journaling has been proven to be helpful for mental clarity, I like to think this is different, I like to think that maybe what is plain for me to see is a new perspective to others. And who cares if it isn't.
			If there is no point in anything there is no point in nothing, a nihilist should never cry, and if they do they have simply proven themselves wrong.</p>
