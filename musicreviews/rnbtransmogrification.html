	   <h2>R&B Transmogrification 7.5/10</h2>
	   <dl>
	    <dt><strong>Ghost Dreaming</strong></dt>
	     <dd>Starting off strong in the album, there's some great harmony in this song, and that paired with the descending chord progression and Quasi's consistently great poetry make this an excellent opening track. 8/10</dd>
	   <br>
	    <dt><strong>Ballad of Mechanical Man</strong></dt>
	     <dd>A direct punch in the face, this song is loud and quick tempoed, making it a complete opposite of the previous track. To me it shares a lot of similarites with one of Quasi's later tracks "California" (on ft. birds). I like the writing, but the song is just alright. 6/10</dd>
	   <br>
	    <dt><strong>In the First Place</strong></dt>
	     <dd>This song's beginning is the end of the song before it. It's also better than the song before it. Not really my favorite, but still good. 7/10</dd>
	   <br> 
	    <dt><strong>Bird's Eye View</strong></dt>
	     <dd>I'm pleasantly suprised with this song. It's a little bit different from the usual Quasi formula, but I actually love it. Quasi doesn't just rely on good songwriting, but can actually make competent, catchy compositions. Amazing. 9/10</dd>
	   <br> 
	    <dt><strong>Two Faced</strong></dt>
	     <dd>This one's also a bit different, but not bad. I actually prefer the guitar to the rocksichord. Pretty basic, but that don't matter. 7/10</dd>
	   <br> 
	    <dt><strong>Ghost Vs. Vampire</strong></dt>
	     <dd>By the end, this song makes itself stand out as another powerful track on the album, at least to me. There's of course the verses, but the latter half of the song is full of some really catchy instrumental bits. 7.5/10</dd>
     <br>
	    <dt><strong>R&B Transmogrification</strong></dt>
	     <dd>For being the titular track, I don't find this one to be exceptional. I think I understand what they were going for, and I do think they achieved it, but I just don't think I exactly like the style they wanted. 7/10</dd>
	   <br>
	    <dt><strong>When I'm Dead</strong></dt>
	     <dd>At some time or another everyone realizes they will die. The lyrics reflect what one ponders will happen to their body when they die. Making a love song is easy because it's kinda like one of those universal experiences. So is an existential crisis, to a degree. Musically it's good too. 7.5/10</dd>
	   <br>
	    <dt><strong>Sugar</strong></dt>
	     <dd>This is the kind of song I love Quasi for, and I'd say it's the style they do best. Lyrics, great. Catchy too. Simple, wonderful. The noise at the end is artistic, but unnessisary, so just skip it. 9/10</dd>
	   <br>
	    <dt><strong>My Coffin</strong></dt>
	     <dd>I don't know what it is about this guy just bashing on his toy keyboard, but its a little annoying to me. The song does get a whole lot better after the intro if you're willing to sit through it. It's another song about death and wanting to die. It sounds like the shit they sing in the haunted mansion graveyard, but that doesn't detract from it. I think it's actually great. 8/10</dd>
	   <br>
	    <dt><strong>Mama, Papa, Baby</strong></dt>
	     <dd>I think this song is catchy as hell, but I kinda wish they would use an instrument other than the rocksichord. Don't get me wrong, it's a very unique sound that Quasi makes the most of, but I feel like the song would've sounded better if it had a less harsh distorted tone. As always still sounds good. 8/10</dd>
	     <br>
	    <dt><strong>Chocolate Rabbit</strong></dt>
	     <dd>This has to be one of the best songs on the album. I really do think the guitar does more favors for this band than the rocksichord, it keeps the distortion, but less harshly. The combonation of the band + slight flanged synths also sounds pretty good. He sounds like he's speaking through a telephone for the majority of the song, but hand in hand with the lyrics he turns off the filter to emphasize a point in the song. Very good. 9/10</dd>
	 	<br>
	    <dt><strong>The Iron Worm</strong></dt>
	     <dd>The song is full of noise, but only when it's needed emotionally. The noise is cut through by some peices of a melody until it completely goes away and turns into a nice melodic moment. 7/10 </dd>
		<br>
	    <dt><strong>Clouds</strong></dt>
	     <dd>A great song and a perfect finale. I know I always say this, but it'd be great in a movie. It captures a sentimental feeling that only late nineties music does for me. 8/10</dd>

	<p>This album has a lot of great moments. You can still tell that the band was figuring out their sound a little bit, and they sound a little less developed than Featuring Birds in this album. There's moments I don't like for sure in this album, but they always manage to turn what I don't like about a song around and make it good again. I was very happy with this album as I wasn't so sure how it would sound going in, but I ended up finding a few new favorites. I still wouldn't recommend it as much as Featuring Birds, but it's still a solid album from one of my new favorite bands.</p>
