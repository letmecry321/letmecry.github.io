			<h2>Wolf : 9.5/10</h2>
	   <br>
	   <dl>
	    <dt><strong>WOLF : 9/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd> Pretty short but I love the instrumental build up with the “fuck youuuuu” in the background. Definitely not the most creative song he’s come up with but still a good way to start the album.</dd>
	   <br>
	    <dt><strong>Jamba : 8.5/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd> I’ve been listening to this song for so long and never even took the time to look at the lyrics, now I find out the chorus doesn't say “jamba” but instead it says “shut em’ down”. Anyways for the actual review part I really enjoy this song, once again Hodgy doesn’t disappoint when being featured. The rhythm is solid and I enjoy the bass in the background. Pretty much the entire song is about doing drugs so not very lyrically deep.</dd>
	   <br>
	    <dt><strong>Cowboy : 7/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd>Pretty solid song, definitely not his most impressive piece of music but still catchy. He has very good rhythm while rapping and it transitions well into the chorus. The song has a steady flow that doesn’t really get interrupted which can be nice but sometimes boring.</dd>
	   <br>
	    <dt><strong>Awkward : 7/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd>Minute 2.34 and on carries this song in my opinion. I love the voice modulation used in this song but the beginning does get a little repetitive. I think if he would have added some more lyrics in between the gap of the first appearance of the chorus and the second it would've made the song so much better.</dd>
	   <br>
	    <dt><strong>Domo23 : 8.5/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd>Such a fun song. I love the energy he brings to the way he delivers the flow of his rap by adding certain dynamics and the responsive background to the chorus that sounds like an echo. I can’t define most of the sounds and instruments he uses in the background but I can say I do love how they contribute to the song's energy.</dd>
	   <br>
	    <dt><strong>Answer : 10/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd>I love this song and I think a big part of that is due to the emotionally deep lyrics in it. To sum it up from my perspective I believe this song is both Tyler’s rage and solace from his dad not being present in his life. He hates him but he wants to know him and he’s split between the two. He also believes he has to thank him for “fire-starting” his career because most of his songs do reference the rage of his father not being present in his life. I also love his delivery while rapping during this song, it's more like he's talking to us in rhythm then yelling angry words into a microphone (which I also love).</dd>
    <br>
	    <dt><strong>Slater : 8/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd>The chorus gets repetitive but when Frank comes in the last 50 seconds the song turns into this angelic mix of humming chords and flowing rap. I feel like they both share the space of the song equally without fighting for the spotlight. It just flows really well.</dd>
	   <br>
	    <dt><strong>48 : 9/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd>The story building in this song is perfect. Every lyric has a purpose and it gets across every point it’s trying to make without stretching out the song. It’s a comfortable length and has a good mix of lyrical flow and chorus. After reviewing the lyrics I had to rate this song much higher.</dd>
	   <br>
	    <dt><strong>Colossus : 10/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd>The build up in this song due to the volume of the musical accompaniment growing with the obsessive and toxic content of the lyrics. This song in my opinion is the most lyrically deep in Wolf besides Answer, it’s hard to choose between the two because their themes are so different. I also love the crashing fade of the piano chords at the end, it’s just such a good song.</dd>
	   <br>
	    <dt><strong>PartyIsntOver/Campfire/Bimmer : 10/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd>3 songs in one!! I think they all blend very well into each other with the perfect amount of pause between the next song. Campfire by far is my favorite between the three, I love Laetitia Sadier’s solo during it along with the fade into Bimmer. Frank Ocean also has a beautiful feature in Bimmer, I would especially like to highlight when he sings “sloooowwww”.</dd>
	   <br>
	    <dt><strong>IFHY : 10/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd>I feel like I’m melting into this song when it says “I love you,” for the first time. The emotion, the lyrics, the sounds, the lyrical spacing, the vocals, even the fade at the end into speaking, everything in this song is as close to perfection as you can get. A masterpiece to put it simply.</dd>
	   <br>
	    <dt><strong>Pigs : 9.5/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd>I deeply enjoy all the background sounds in this song. The sirens, the crashing, the high pitched voice responding to Tyler, it really builds to the destructive and angry nature of this song. I also love the “bum bum bum” part, it’s weird to type that out but you’d get it if you listened to the song.</dd>
	   <br>
	    <dt><strong>Rusty : 9/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd>I really like Tyler’s verse in this song. The other two features do a great job but Tyler’s lyrics are what really makes this such an engaging song along with the chorus. I wish I could describe deeper how much I enjoy the instrumental background but unfortunately I still haven't familiarized myself enough with musical production and the names of instruments.</dd>
	   <br>
	    <dt><strong>Trashwag : 9/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd>A bunch of angry men screaming in the mic usually wouldn’t be my first choice to listen to but this song does a really good job at having a balance of energy throughout the song. I really love this song, the only thing I may change is the plain speaking from 3:30-3:53 but it really doesn’t make that big difference to me. </dd>
	   <br>
	    <dt><strong>Treehome95 : 8/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd>Definitely a change up from Tyler’s usual style. I love all the different layers of vocals, but I do wish he was more highlighted in the song then what he is, but hey, you can’t have everything you wish for.</dd>
	   </dl> 
	   <br>
  <dt><strong>Tamale : 9/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd>Such a fun song. I love the unseriousness of it, it definitely gives a good break between the other very melancholy and angry content in this album.</dd>
	   </dl> 
	   <br>
  <dt><strong>Lone : 9/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd>The instrumentals are angelic. They really add to the emotional content of the song. Such a beautiful way to end the album.</dd>
	   </dl> 
	   <br>  
	   <p>Wolf reaches my soul in both the lyrics and the instrumental build up in the songs. It changes back and forth from rage to solace, to fun, to rage again. The entire album takes me on a whole emotional journey and leaves me feeling slightly melancholy once it's over. I believe Wolf is a great display of his range of ability in the production of his music. This is an album I find myself listening to very often and I definitely believe it’s worth listening to at least once. </p>
