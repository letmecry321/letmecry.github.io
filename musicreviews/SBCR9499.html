	  <p>Hi, it's me, H, the guy who does most of the rock reviews. What in the HELL am I doing here in a screamo review? Well, I have a particular liking to Strictly Ballroom's unique soundscapes and composition. This is their only album, being a discography, so it's long as fuck. ALSO i will be doing the album out of order, instead implementing my own order by year.</p></div>

	   <h2>1996</h2>
	    <dt><strong>A Picture</strong></dt>
	     <dd>Beautiful guitars coming from each side of the ear. Kinda a Beatles-esque effect, but when it all comes together and blends, it's amazing. I usually don't like a lot of guitar/vocal effects, but they've achieved a nice balance with reverb distortion etc. Though I quite enjoy it, it doesn't hold as a standout in this album to me, more of a tonesetter (it's supposed to be first on the album). Math rocky. 7/10 </dd>
	   <br>
	    <dt><strong>Crickets</strong></dt>
	     <dd>Lethargic, melancholy, beautiful. A very calming song at first, but you notice it starting to pick up into a burst of angst and energy. I'm not sure how I feel about the singing, I actually prefer the screaming surprisingly. The energy then subsides and we're back to the main riff for a while. Then a sudden return to its peak with a tearful scream until it cuts off. 9/10</dd>
	   <br>
	    <dt><strong>Elevator Action</strong></dt>
	     <dd>More of the excitement and intensity that I was enjoying. There are moments of calm, yet even in those you hear the distortion so the song still holds its identity instead of being a mash of like 2 songs or something. Honestly really impressive to compose a song this way; a peak, then a valley, then a lower peak and a lower valley before drifting off. 8/10</dd>
	   <br> 
	    <dt><strong>Trains In The Distance At Night</strong></dt>
	     <dd>A perfect song to pair with the nighttime. I can imagine driving late on old winding back roads seeing the moon past barren trees while this song plays. There's a couple fake-out build ups, but for the most part the song stays chill with one relatively intense moment. For SURE a vibe. 9/10</dd>
	   <br> 
	    <dt><strong>Something That Just Is</strong></dt>
	     <dd>This guy definitely has a grunge voice, I think I like the other singer better. At least the instrumental is compelling. And oh hey the other guy sings the chorus ok thats good. 6/10 saved by the instrumental and the incorporation of the screaming.</dd>
	   <br> 
	    <dt><strong>This Will Self-Destruct</strong></dt>
	     <dd>Ah, SB's bread and butter in my opinion. It's not just an instrumental, but a soundscape. The song mastefully builds tension with extremely simple guitar riffs before changing its mood entirely. This song would play in a scene where the protaganist is hopelessly lost in a nighttime apacolypse desert scenario. I can imagine the sand whipped up by the wind as he treks through the wastes to return back to the bunker or something. i dunno this song makes my 2 neurons connect. 9/10</dd>
     <br>
	    <dt><strong>Knots on a Counting Rope</strong></dt>
	     <dd>Hey what the hell they reused the riff. It's more like a variation on a theme, or an artistic motif, as the feel of the song is entirely different. I'll let it slide this time. This one has screaming, which is alright. Doesn't activate my imagination in the same way as This Will Self Destruct does though. 8/10.</dd>
	   <br>
	    <dt><strong>A Sudden Interest In Nature</strong></dt>
	     <dd>Back to the slower, more somber tone at first. I enjoy the buildup for the most part, but the grunge guy comes back which is meh. This is my quintessential "Strictly Ballroom" song. It represents all of the best parts of the band. Slow, fast, sad, hopeful, plus a soundscape. What more could you ask for. Speaking of the soundscape, the transition from song to scape is seamless and perfect. Music should strive to tell a story without words, and this piece does not miss the mark. 10/10 even though i hold a grunge grudge</dd>
	   <br>
	    <dt><strong>Escape Plan #4</strong></dt>
	     <dd>The synthetic and almost industrial sounds remind me immediately of Half Life 2's and Portal 2's soundtracks. Yes I know that's a dumb comparison but it was the first thing I thought of when I heard it. Very dark, and almost imposing like some sort of monolithic presence. 7/10</dd>
