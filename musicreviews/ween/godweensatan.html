			<p>This is ween's first album ever. It's rough around the edges but shows the potential of what ween could eventually be. Some of it is actually pretty good. Some of it is not good.</p>

			<dt><strong>You Fucked Up</strong></dt>
			  <dd>Pretty heavy compared to later ween. They're going for a very punk-y sound with this opener, and it definitely catches your attention when you're listening, but after listening it is instantly forgotten unfortunately. 6/10</dd>
			  <br>
			  <dt><strong>Tick</strong></dt>
			  <dd>While rougher than their later albums, this song is very catchy and surprisingly has entertaining lyrics and competent composition. Still punky. 8/10</dd>
			  <br>
			  <dt><strong>I'm in The Mood to Move</strong></dt>
			  <dd>Kinda funny, but not a song. 3/10 would never listen to this again</dd>
			  <br>
			  <dt><strong>I Got a Weasel</strong></dt>
			  <dd>The best thing going for this song is that it is a chance for Gene to show off some of his voices. This is also barely even a song but manages to be kinda catchy. Nothing worth relistening to unfortunately. 6/10</dd>
			  <br>
			  <dt><strong>Fat Lenny</strong></dt>
			  <dd>Ween featuring Eric Cartman screaming. TH Curnchers level of songwriting. By the end of the song you kinda accept the screaming and it's actually not that bad, being saved mostly by the guitar. 5/10. </dd>
			  <br>
			  <dt><strong>Cold 'N' Wet</strong></dt>
			  <dd>By this point in the album, I was starting to understand their limitations. One of the most beautiful parts of ween is their ability to have bullshit lyrics and turn them into a good song. Unfortunately at the time of this album, they had a 4 track tape recorder, a drum track, and distorted guitar. You can see what they're going for, but it just barely misses the mark. 5/10</dd>
			  <br>
			  <dt><strong>Bumblebee</strong></dt>
			  <dd>Another joke song that really isn't worth listening to after the first time. Unfortunate that this album is so cluttered. 3/10</dd>
			  <br>
			  <dt><strong>Don't Laugh (I Love You)</strong></dt>
			  <dd>A true diamond in the rough; this is one of my favorite songs from ween and possibly from any band. They keep the jokey screeches and interjections to a minimum for the most part, and instead of harsh distortion and noise they have a nice chorus effect on the guitar, as well as an incredible bassline. The ending is silly too, and in my opinion I dont think it drags the song too much. 10/10</dd>
			  <br>
			  <dt><strong>Never Squeal (On Th' Pusher)</strong></dt>
			  <dd>I always appreciate when they are obviously trying new things. And when they make a song listenable. Until the lawnmower starts. I find that part annoying. Pretty catchy actually, and hard to believe this is even the same singer from the last song. 7/10</dd>
			  <br>
			  <dt><strong>Up On Th' Hill</strong></dt>
			  <dd>This song is charming, and shows how much potential Gener clearly had in the early days of ween. 7/10</dd>
			  <br>
			  <dt><strong>Wayne's Pet Youngin'</strong></dt>
			  <dd>Catchy, loud, and like much of the album, punky. They are good at making guitar and vocal riffs and blending them cohesively. 7/10</dd>
			  <br>
			  <dt><strong>Nicole</strong></dt>
			  <dd>They're sort of poking fun at Reggae music, but their way of doing that is just by making a decent song in the genre, and leaning into the cheesiness of it. They put their own spin on it too. I'll say this song is probably good enough to listen to more than once. The only thing is this song absolutely DRAGS. 9 minutes is an abysmal length for any song. 8/10</dd>
			  <br>
			  <dt><strong>Common Bitch</strong></dt>
			  <dd>These fuckers love screaming. The guitar is great in this song though. Not much else to say. 6/10</dd>
			  <br>
			  <dt><strong>El Camino</strong></dt>
			  <dd>Shit sounds like Veggie Tales. It's alright. Actually pretty funny. But not funny enough to be memorable. 5/10</dd>
			  <br>
			  <dt><strong>Old Queen Cole</strong></dt>
			  <dd>There are too many of these types of song on the album. It makes it seem cluttered instead of a proper selection of their best songs of the time. 6/10</dd>
			  <br>
			  <dt><strong>Nan</strong></dt>
			  <dd>This song's lyrics are silly and pretty bad, in a jokey way of course. The instrumental is really compelling actually, building up tension and excitement. Kinda reminds me of some other bands like <a href="https://letmecry.com/strictlyballroom">strictly ballroom</a>. What's your big secret baby? 8/10</dd>
			  <br>
			  <dt><strong>Licking The Palm For Guava</strong></dt>
			  <dd>I think this is parodying dead kennedys? very short but funny 4/10</dd>
			  <br>
			  <dt><strong>Mushroom Festival in Hell</strong></dt>
			  <dd>This is just continuing the previous song. WoowWWOOoowwWOOOoww is how this one sounds. Kinda rough. Experimental. 4/10</dd>
			  <br>
			  <dt><strong>L.M.L.Y.P</strong></dt>
			  <dd>A good funky parody song. A parody of what? Something i dunno. Lyrics are very sick animation-esque. Or maybe he's just ween-esque? who cares. This song is very fun, but it kiiiiiiiinda drags on which is fine. It's always more disappointing to me when a good song is too short, I dont mind more of a good song. Also that talk box is awesome. 7/10</dd>
			  <br>
			  <dt><strong>Papa Zit</strong></dt>
			  <dd>I'm not a fan of this song. It's just not quite my style and yet another "clutter" song to me. 6/10</dd>
			  <br>
			  <dt><strong>Old Man Thunder</strong></dt>
			  <dd>This song is- oh. thats it. thats the song. its over. huh. 5/10 i guess??</dd>
			  <br>
			  <dt><strong>Birthday Boy</strong></dt>
			  <dd>I like the instruments used in this song. It sounds like it would be on a later album like chocolate and cheese. It's well written, but it kinda sounds like it's playing through a broken speaker, which is probably intentional. There's just no bass for some reason. 8/10</dd>
			  <br>
			  <dt><strong>Blackjack</strong></dt>
			  <dd>This is what having a stroke sounds like I think. Big black betty flap jack eddie uhhhhh fatty flap jack AAAAWWWW big spack nish netty big balck jebtty banidsh ediie. This is 100% improvised, and you can hear them laughing at themselves. It's very charming. little spanish eddie/10</dd>
			  <br>
			  <dt><strong>Squelch the Weasel</strong></dt>
			  <dd>Oddly high quality for this album and for a joke song. There's a bit a shit recording mistakes and artifacts, but I think they realized they could actually try when making music, so they did. Beautiful. 9/10</dd>
			  <br>
			  <dt><strong>Marble Tulip Juicy Tree</strong></dt>
			  <dd>Another above-average Veggie Tales ass song. I like it well enough, and it's pretty unique. I believe this is parodying "The Clash" and the like? not certain though. I this song is very well placed at 2nd to last in the album order. 8/10</dd>
			  <br>
			  <dt><strong>Puffy Cloud</strong></dt>
			  <dd>I've been here before. A happy ending, drifting off on a puffy cloud. my brain is dead from too much pot, cause gene and i smoke too much pot. This song is not that good but very charming 7/10</dd>

				<p>This album is very rough, as it's their first. There are a lot of songs that are mediocre if not bad that I wouldn't mind just being excluded from the album and kept somewhere as demos or something. The roughness has its charm though, and I enjoyed my listen to a good majority of these 20-something songs. The worst thing this album does is be kinda forgettable. I can excuse the roughness of the recording but some of the songs just fail to interest me or drag on for too long etc. </p><strong>6/10</strong>
