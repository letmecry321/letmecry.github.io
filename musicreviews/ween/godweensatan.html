			<p>This is ween's first album ever. It's rough around the edges but shows the potential of what ween could eventually be. Some of it is actually pretty good. Some of it is not good.</p>

			<dt><strong>You Fucked Up</strong></dt>
			  <dd>Pretty heavy compared to later ween. They're going for a very punk-y sound with this opener, and it definitely catches your attention when you're listening, but after listening it is instantly forgotten unfortunately. 6/10</dd>
			  <br>
			  <dt><strong>Tick</strong></dt>
			  <dd>While rougher than their later albums, this song is very catchy and surprisingly has entertaining lyrics and competent composition. Still punky. 8/10</dd>
			  <br>
			  <dt><strong>I'm in The Mood to Move</strong></dt>
			  <dd>Kinda funny, but not a song. 3/10 would never listen to this again</dd>
			  <br>
			  <dt><strong>I Got a Weasel</strong></dt>
			  <dd>The best thing going for this song is that it is a chance for Gene to show off some of his voices. This is also barely even a song but manages to be kinda catchy. Nothing worth relistening to unfortunately. 6/10</dd>
			  <br>
			  <dt><strong>Fat Lenny</strong></dt>
			  <dd>Ween featuring Eric Cartman screaming. TH Curnchers level of songwriting. By the end of the song you kinda accept the screaming and it's actually not that bad, being saved mostly by the guitar. 5/10. </dd>
			  <br>
			  <dt><strong>Cold 'N' Wet</strong></dt>
			  <dd>By this point in the album, I was starting to understand their limitations. One of the most beautiful parts of ween is their ability to have bullshit lyrics and turn them into a good song. Unfortunately at the time of this album, they had a 4 track tape recorder, a drum track, and distorted guitar. You can see what they're going for, but it just barely misses the mark. 5/10</dd>
			  <br>
			  <dt><strong>Bumblebee</strong></dt>
			  <dd>Another joke song that really isn't worth listening to after the first time. Unfortunate that this album is so cluttered. 3/10</dd>
			  <br>
			  <dt><strong>Don't Laugh (I Love You)</strong></dt>
			  <dd>A true diamond in the rough; this is one of my favorite songs from ween and possibly from any band. They keep the jokey screeches and interjections to a minimum for the most part, and instead of harsh distortion and noise they have a nice chorus effect on the guitar, as well as an incredible bassline. The ending is silly too, and in my opinion I dont think it drags the song too much. 10/10</dd>
			  <br>
			  <dt><strong>Never Squeal (On Th' Pusher)</strong></dt>
			  <dd>I always appreciate when they are obviously trying new things. And when they make a song listenable. Until the lawnmower starts. I find that part annoying. Pretty catchy actually, and hard to believe this is even the same singer from the last song. 7/10</dd>
			  <br>
			  <dt><strong>Up On Th' Hill</strong></dt>
			  <dd>This song is charming, and shows how much potential Gener clearly had in the early days of ween. 7/10</dd>
			  <br>
			  <dt><strong>Wayne's Pet Youngin'</strong></dt>
			  <dd>Catchy, loud, and like much of the album, punky. They are good at making guitar and vocal riffs and blending them cohesively. 7/10</dd>
			  <br>
			  <dt><strong>Nicole</strong></dt>
			  <dd>They're sort of poking fun at Reggae music, but their way of doing that is just by making a decent song in the genre, and leaning into the cheesiness of it. They put their own spin on it too. I'll say this song is probably good enough to listen to more than once. The only thing is this song absolutely DRAGS. 9 minutes is an abysmal length for any song. 8/10</dd>
			  <br>
			  <dt><strong>Common Bitch</strong></dt>
			  <dd>These fuckers love screaming. The guitar is great in this song though. Not much else to say. 6/10</dd>
			  <br>
			  <dt><strong>El Camino</strong></dt>
			  <dd>Shit sounds like Veggie Tales. It's alright. Actually pretty funny. But not funny enough to be memorable. 5/10</dd>
			  <br>
			  <dt><strong>Old Queen Cole</strong></dt>
			  <dd>There are too many of these types of song on the album. It makes it seem cluttered instead of a proper selection of their best songs of the time. 6/10</dd>
