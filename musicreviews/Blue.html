			<h2>Blue : 9/10</h2>
	   <br>
	   <dl>
	    <dt><strong>All I Want : 8/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd> A wonderful opening to this near perfect album. The off-kilter opening draws the listener in. In this song Joni talks about her desire for an innocent perfect love she knows dosen't exist, a ove that could set her free.</dd>
	   <br>
	    <dt><strong>My Old Man : 9/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd> A beautiful piano ballad. The warmness of the piano and the smoothness of Joni's voice compliment eachother perfectly. The lyrics, though simple, beautifully show Joni's affection for her lover. "He's the warmest chord I ever heard." The warmth and coziness of the verses of the song beautifully contrast the song's bridge. The piano suddenly shifts to a mysterious minor progression that leaves the listener with and indescribably gutwrenching feeling.</dd>

	    <dt><strong>Little Green : 7./10</strong></dt>
	     <dd>This song is objectively good but is so boring i almost don't care. This is song about Joni's daughter's name seems out of place amoung an album about love, and self discovery. This song's lyrics are good but the repetitiveness of the song makes me fall asleep. I do like it's bridge (as always) and the plucky strings.</dd>

	    <dt><strong>Carey: 7.5/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd> The cocaine song. Fun. Not as deep as the rest of the album, but hey it's the cocaine song (well maybe. In some transcriptions of the lyrics it is spelled "caine", but the official spelling is "cane" supposedly in reference to the small hiking stick Carey would keep with him).</dd>
	   <br>
		    <dt><strong>Blue: 9.5/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd> "Blue songs are like tattoos" Beatiful song but I am taken out of it everytime that bridge comes around,because i know she is say "lots of laughs", but i hear "Lots of ass". The piano feels like a ship at sea during a storm. She wallows in fact that in a world that seems to prioritize pleasure so many are falling into depression. The only way Joni can cope is by making space for her depression with a tattoo: this song.</dd>
	   <br>
		    <dt><strong>California: 9/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd> So joyous. This song celebrates fleeting joy, escapism, and the idea of california as a place where you can be free. Also remember Carey? CAREY IS THE REDNECK. When Joni was writing both "California" and "Carey" she was living with hippies in a cave in Matala, Crete. The song "Carey was in fact a birthday present for the mean old daddy himself. Carey also hated the song california. In a 2014 interveiw he said, "I was taken aback that she referred to me as a “redneck on a Grecian isle.” I was from North Carolina, so my accent was strong, but I was hardly that. But look, she was just writing songs. You can’t really take these things all that seriously. And I did take her camera, as the song says, but I didn’t sell it. I gave it back to her later." I still like the song though.</dd>
