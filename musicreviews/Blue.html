			<h2>Blue : 9/10</h2>
	   <br>
	   <dl>
	    <dt><strong>All I Want : 8/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd> A wonderful opening to this near perfect album. The off-kilter opening draws the listener in. In this song Joni talks about her desire for an innocent perfect love she knows dosen't exist, a ove that could set her free.</dd>
	   <br>
	    <dt><strong>My Old Man : 9/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd> A beautiful piano ballad. The warmness of the piano and the smoothness of Joni's voice compliment eachother perfectly. The lyrics, though simple, beautifully show Joni's affection for her lover. "He's the warmest chord I ever heard." The warmth and coziness of the verses of the song beautifully contrast the song's bridge. The piano suddenly shifts to a mysterious minor progression that leaves the listener with and indescribably gutwrenching feeling.</dd>
	   <br>
	    <dt><strong>Little Green : 7./10</strong></dt>
	     <dd>This song is objectively good but is so boring i almost don't care. This is song about Joni's daughter's name seems out of place amoung an album about love, and self discovery. This song's lyrics are good but the repetitiveness of the song makes me fall asleep. I do like it's bridge (as always) and the plucky strings.</dd>
	   <br>
	    <dt><strong>Carey: 7.5/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd> The cocaine song. Fun. Not as deep as the rest of the album, but hey it's the cocaine song (well maybe. In some transcriptions of the lyrics it is spelled "caine", but the official spelling is "cane" supposedly in reference to the small hiking stick Carey would keep with him). <img src="Images/Carey.jpg" alt="Carey"> </dd>
	   <br>
		    <dt><strong>Blue: 9.5/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd> "Blue songs are like tattoos" Beatiful song but I am taken out of it everytime that bridge comes around,because i know she is say "lots of laughs", but i hear "Lots of ass". The piano feels like a ship at sea during a storm. She wallows in fact that in a world that seems to prioritize pleasure so many are falling into depression. The only way Joni can cope is by making space for her depression with a tattoo: this song.</dd>
	   <br>
		    <dt><strong>California: 9/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd> So joyous. This song celebrates fleeting joy, escapism, and the idea of california as a place where you can be free. Also remember Carey? CAREY IS THE REDNECK. When Joni was writing both "California" and "Carey" she was living with hippies in a cave in Matala, Crete. The song "Carey was in fact a birthday present for the mean old daddy himself. Carey also hated the song california. In a 2014 interveiw he said, "I was taken aback that she referred to me as a “redneck on a Grecian isle.” I was from North Carolina, so my accent was strong, but I was hardly that. But look, she was just writing songs. You can’t really take these things all that seriously. And I did take her camera, as the song says, but I didn’t sell it. I gave it back to her later." I still like the song though.</dd>
	   <br>
		    <dt><strong>This Flight Tonight: 8/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd> This is a good song. It is not spectacular by any means, but it is enjoyable to listen to, it has a nice bouncey rythym, and tells a cute and kinda sad story about regretting leaving your lover.</dd>
			 <br>
		     <dt><strong> River: 10/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd> Oh my god. This song perfectly captures the sad feeling the holidays can bring. Joni's voice seems to dance above the piano which sounds like snowflakes falling to the ground. It is genuinly baffling to me how this song is so beautiful, while being an interpilation of JINGLE BELLS. This song perfectly sums up the entire album. It has a feeing of warmth and home, freedom and escapism, and depression and longing. IT shows the sadness of a lost love set against the hapiest time of all.</dd>
			 <br>
		     <dt><strong> A Case of You: 9/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd> This song has the best lyrics of any track on this album. It feels oddly stripped down compared to rest of the album. But that is not a bad thing. The minimal production makes the song feel intimate. This song brings back the idea of her lover being a star, as she talks of in this flight tonigh, but now with a different connotation. "Just before our love got lost you said "I am as constant as a northern star," and i said "constantly in the darkness, where is that at? If you want me I'll be in the bar>" oof. I also like how the name carries two meanings. Not only that she could "drink a case" of her lover, but also that she is ill ffrom his love "a case" of him.</dd>
			 <br>
		     <dt><strong>The Last Time I Saw Richard: 8.5/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd> Wow, so Joni realyy is at the bar. I find this song good but it does suffer from being at the end of the album. This song is about a conversation between Joni and her first husband. Her ex-husband tells her all romantics end up hiding drunk in bars. Joni refutes his claim, but we later see where she ends up. Its very touching and a nice ending to this wonderful album.</dd>
			 <br>
	   <p>This is currently my favorite album. I was very close to rating it 10/10 but there are a few lesser songs ( Little Green and Carey). They arent bad songs but they aren't on par with the rest of the album. This is some of the only folk music I like. Although her lyrics can be corny at times, Joni truely has a skill with the pen, and an exellent voice as well.</p>
