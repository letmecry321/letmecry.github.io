			<h2>Blue : 9/10</h2>
	   <br>
	   <dl>
	    <dt><strong>All I Want : 8/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd> A wonderful opening to this near perfect album. The off-kilter opening draws the listener in. In this song Joni talks about her desire for an innocent perfect love she knows dosen't exist, a ove that could set her free.</dd>
	   <br>
	    <dt><strong>My Old Man : 9/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd> A beautiful piano ballad. The warmness of the piano and the smoothness of Joni's voice compliment eachother perfectly. The lyrics, though simple, beautifully show Joni's affection for her lover. "He's the warmest chord I ever heard." The warmth and coziness of the verses of the song beautifully contrast the song's bridge. The piano suddenly shifts to a mysterious minor progression that leaves the listener with and indescribably gutwrenching feeling.</dd>

	    <dt><strong>Little Green : 7.5/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd>This song is objectively good but is so boring i almost don't care. This is song about Joni's daughter's name seems out of place amoung an album about love, and self discovery. This song's lyrics are good but the repetitiveness of the song makes me fall asleep</dd>
	   <br>
	   <p>Reviewing this album all at once was very depressing but worth getting the privilege to deeply listen to this artist's first official release. I was already pretty familiar with most of these songs but I still enjoyed getting to listen to the album in order while reading the (traumatizing) lyrics along with the music. I think it was a pretty decent start to his flourishing career and definitely worth relistening to.</p>
