			<h2>Goblin : 9/10</h2>

	    <dt><strong>Goblin : 9/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd> Throwback to Bastard, we see the voice modulation again with the counselor but this time he plays a bigger role in communicating with Tyler during the entire song instead of here and there. The build up of the piano and chords in the background is beautiful and definitely pairs well with Tyler’s rhythm of speech. In all I love this song and the dialogue really allows you to peer into the artist's personal problems with fame.</dd>
	   <br>
	    <dt><strong>Yonkers : 9/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd> I love the last 5 seconds of this song, especially if I’m wearing headphones. The sound fading to each side of your head is just very enticing to me, you’ll get it if you listen to it. Besides that, it's a very solid song.</dd>
	   <br>
	    <dt><strong>Radicals : 7/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd>I find this song very humorous but maybe my humor is broken. The disclaimer at the beginning always makes me chuckle and the dramatics during the song make me smile. The transition from heavy hate screaming into the mike into “you gotta let ‘em go” is also very good. It does get a little repetitive after a while but I still enjoy the song a lot.</dd>
	   <br>
	    <dt><strong>She : 9/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd>Cute little stalker song, plus Frank Ocean makes an appearance. It’s very catchy and gets stuck in your head easily. I also love the little scream at the end. </dd>
	   <br>
	    <dt><strong>Transylvania : 6.5/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd>It’s an okay song, I love the piano in it but besides that nothing really stands out.</dd>
	   <br>
	    <dt><strong>Nightmare : 7.5/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd>Tyler grapples with emotions of the past and present along with having to deal with “Tron Cat” who is pretty much the devil on his shoulders. It’s very catchy but kind of repetitive at times. I wish I knew more about instrumentals to go in depth about the sounds I like in this song but I’ll just say that I like the background music a lot.</dd>
    <br>
	    <dt><strong>Tron Cat : 10/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd>I LOVE the “la la la la, la la laaaaaaaa ahhhhhhhh” at the beginning, it feels like we can hear what Tron Cat sounds like in Tyler’s head. So good. This song is pretty much all the terrible things that Tron Cat draws him to. Also I love about everything about this song, it’s just so catchy I just wish it wasn't so dark sometimes. It also has the fading of sound from ear to ear at the end which I’m finding myself falling in love with in every song he puts it in.</dd>
	   <br>
	    <dt><strong>Her : 9.5/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd>Better than she in my opinion, they probably don’t have a reason to be compared but I always imagine they are connected. I love the repetition of “this girl” in the background, I don't know if the faded voice in the background just makes the song better in my opinion. I don’t find this as a love song but more as an obsessive fantasy with a girl who has a relationship. He definitely has a concerning way to make lyrics that depict a completely different emotion if you don’t listen closely. Either way it’s a very good song.</dd>
	   <br>
	    <dt><strong>Sandwiches : 7.5/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd>Okay. I think the lyrics are really lacking in the chorus but wow the rest of the song. I mean any song with Hodgy and Tyler I find myself loving so maybe I'm biased, but I truly do find the rhythm great in this song. I also like the last few seconds where he explains that this isn’t horrorcore but something much deeper.</dd>
	   <br>
	    <dt><strong>Fish : 9/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd>Two songs in one, both great songs. The first I find myself physically sinking into the music due to the piano and the synth. The second I find myself dancing along with the music. Of course this is all in the comfort of my car to avoid the social embarrassment of physically moving to the song in public.</dd>
	   <br>
	    <dt><strong>Analog : 10/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd>Such a catchy song. I love the humming in the background during the song. I love the “we can watch the sunset” part, I can definitely tell they had a fun time recording this song.</dd>
	   <br>
	    <dt><strong>B.S.D : 6/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd>Not a great song, I like the aggression but it’s not very creative. The only memorable part of the song for me is from minute 0.58 to 1.25, I just like the way the lyrics are delivered.</dd>
	   <br>
	    <dt><strong>Window : 8.5/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd>Transitioning from B.S.D to this song is insane, never would I think such an unserious song like B.S.D would be followed by this beautiful collaboration between multiple artists. Tyler’s part in the song is very emotional in my opinion, it highlights his money struggles and how he grapples with fame now that he is liked by others. The last minute or so is pretty much dialogue between Tyler and Dr. TC, he screams for help after killing his friend. I don’t know, I find myself very connected to his emotion but maybe people just skip over it.</dd>
	   <br>
	    <dt><strong>AU79 : 5/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd>Just instrumental. I don’t know, it's okay. </dd>
	   <br>
	    <dt><strong>Golden : 8.5/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd>The big reveal, Dr. TC is Tyler’s conscience. Everything wrong and good that’s inside of him telling him what he should or shouldn’t do. I would say this song is Tyler’s cry for help, screaming at those who weren’t there for him before Bastard or even during it. He finds people wanting him for success even though how he got there was through lies and sacrifices. I know this is pretty much all explained in the lyrics but I thought I’d recap it for those who are too lazy to actually listen. Anyway, the song in general has a very smooth rhythm and is full of emotion. A great way to originally end the album before releasing part 2.</dd>

	   <br>
  <dt><strong>Burger : 8/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd>Hodgy is everywhere in the album. Good thing I’m a fan of his collabs. This song is just very fun and a little silly. We also get a callback to Sandwiches at minute 2.45 but the lyrics change, I think I like Burger’s version better.</dd>
	   </dl> 
	   <br>
  <dt><strong>Untitled 63 : 4.5/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd>Another instrumental song. I like the drums but mainly it’s just a transitional song.</dd>
	   </dl> 
	   <br>  <dt><strong>Steak Sauce : 6.5/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd>I like the background noise, it pairs well with his rap. This song is definitely rap heavy, there is no melody which is fine but I do enjoy having something to return to throughout the song. He has good dynamics and strong diction, but I wouldn’t say I strongly connect to the song.</dd>
	   </dl> 
	   <br>
	   <p>This album has a soft spot to me personally because it has the music that first connected me to Tyler, The Creator. Although the themes can be dark, I find it to be a great way to understand him if you actually listen to the lyrics. If you don’t look too deep into it the music can just be a nice thing to have in the background but actually reviewing what he puts into his songs, I believe, is worth it. This album is both disturbing and fun in my opinion, definitely something of value. </p>
