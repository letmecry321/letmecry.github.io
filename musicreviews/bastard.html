			<h2>Bastard : 7/10</h2>
	   <br>
	   <dl>
	    <dt><strong>Bastard : 8/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd> In my opinion Tyler began this album perfectly. A great mix of rambling thoughts and conversation with the school counselor. The synth notes compliment the steady piano. Also enjoy the voice modulation use.</dd>
	   <br>
	    <dt><strong>Seven : 8/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd> This song has great rhythm and unexpected raunchy lyrics like this gem, “I'm dope enough to ass-fuck the dude who made nicotine.” In all another solid song.</dd>
	   <br>
	    <dt><strong>Odd Toddlers : 5/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd>Features a decent performance by Casey Veggies and highlights Tyler for a few seconds. I like the background trill but the last 1:11 of the song is unnecessary</dd>
	   <br> 
	    <dt><strong>French! : 5/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd>Sickening lyrics. Has a good rhythm but I don’t believe it was his best by any means. </dd>
	   <br> 
	    <dt><strong>Blow : 9/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd>My favorite song in this album by far. The chorus is so catchy especially when it gets to the part where it goes “bl-bl-bl-bloooooww.”</dd>
	   <br> 
	    <dt><strong>Pigs Fly : 6/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd>This song is pretty forgettable, the only redeeming quality is the last 23 seconds if you are wearing headphones.</dd>
     <br>
	    <dt><strong>Parade : 8/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd>I love the pacing of this song, it's quick and to the point without leaving much room for boredom. It also has a catchy chorus and a good transition to the next song.</dd>
	   <br>
	    <dt><strong>Slow It Down : 7/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd>This song features Hodgy whom I find personally better than Casey Veggies in many ways. I find myself getting the chorus stuck in my head often due to it’s repetitiveness. Not very lyrically deep but still a fun song to listen to.</dd>
	   <br>
	    <dt><strong>AssMilk : 5/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd>Had great potential but the dialogue in the middle ruins it for me.</dd>
	   <br>
	    <dt><strong>VCR : 6/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd>The beginning is mediocre and pretty repetitive but after the pause the song redeems itself. I enjoyed the layering of rap and singing combined with the bass of the music.</dd>
	   <br>
	    <dt><strong>Session : 7/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd>I love the intro dialogue slowly fading into rap. I enjoy the piano and the combination of artists, they all blend together very well. Overall pretty solid.</dd>
	   <br>
	    <dt><strong>Sarah : 7/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd>It’s catchy but, wow. The song takes his usual lyrics and creates a story with a girl (Sarah) who I find myself pitying throughout it. It also gives me a need to check my smoke detector whenever I listen to it.</dd>
	   <br>
	    <dt><strong>Jack and the Beanstalk : 7.5/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd>I love the faint “they don’t, paint pictures” during the chorus while Tyler sings. Also the ending with that weird humming instrument, deeply enjoy that.</dd>
	   <br>
	    <dt><strong>Tina : 2/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd>I genuinely hate so much about this song. I would prefer not to rant negatively so I won’t. </dd> 
	   <br>
	    <dt><strong>Inglorious : 7/10</strong></dt>
	     <dd>Pretty decent way to wrap up the album. I like the dramatic suspense of the gun at the end but besides that not much to note.</dd> 
	   </dl>  
	   <br>
	   <p>Reviewing this album all at once was very depressing but worth getting the privilege to deeply listen to this artist's first official release. I was already pretty familiar with most of these songs but I still enjoyed getting to listen to the album in order while reading the (traumatizing) lyrics along with the music. I think it was a pretty decent start to his flourishing career and definitely worth relistening to.</p>
