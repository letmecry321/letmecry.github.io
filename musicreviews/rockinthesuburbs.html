	  <p>This album was released on 9/11... pretty unfortunate.              I literally cannot bring myself to review this album. I have the time probably but it just bores me to death i'm sorry. I should probably remove it but idk man leave me alone we have like a hundred other pages just look somewhere else</p></div>

	     <dd>Just kinda an average pop song. This album marks, in my opinion, when Ben started to switch his focus from rock to pop. You can just hear it in the production of the song, it's just feels a little too synthesized, and I think it'd be a lot better if it was in the Ben Folds Five style. 6/10</dd>

	     <dd>I love this song, it's very fun to play on piano. I like the idea of a schizophrenic girl and her teenage boyfriend who ignores her. This song is insanely catchy and I often find myself playing it on piano without even thinking about it. I also like when he says "asssshoooooooolleeeee" 9/10</dd>
