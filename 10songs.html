            <h2>10 songs : 9/10</h2>
			<br>
			<dl>
			<dt><strong>This Isn't the Tenka-Ichi-Budokai : 8/10</strong></dt>
				<dd>i think this is just the perfect opening song for this album. the album plays a lot with levels of noise and this might be the best song to show that. the lyrics on paper are middle of the line but they hit harder than youd expect. kamehameha</dd>
			<br>
			<dt><strong>Urban Barbie : 8/10</strong></dt>
				<dd>like the first, this is a great example of another type of song featured on this album. instead of shorter punchy moments of screaming emotion, it is a consistant drag, but i don't mean that in a bad way. the lyrics here are pretty good, and pretty memorable. although its not the most impactful, its shockingly catchy.</dd>
			<br>
			<dt><strong>Polar Bear Summer : 9.5/10</strong></dt>
				<dd>this is one of my favorite songs off this album. it's extremely underated, it has a great combination of droning vocals and bursts of energy. not just that either, the intrumental of this track is engaging the entire time. a big problem for some of the songs on this album are the lyrics. if they miss, they really miss, but on this one its one of the best aspects.</dd>
			<br> 
			<dt><strong>...and Keep Reaching for Those Stars : 3/10</strong></dt>
				<dd>and what an example of just terrible lyrics. this is probably my least favorite song on this album. the lyrics suck, the intrumental is boring, and it just feels so amatuer compared to every other song on this album. id just rather not listen to it, its a complete drag. this is the only skip on this album, everything else is at least passable. the last 30 or so seconds is fine, but the first 2 minites arn't worth it.</dd>
			<br> 
			<dt><strong>Caught in a Flood With the Captain of the Cheerleading Squad : 10/10</strong></dt>
				<dd>this is currently my favorite song on the album, it just combines all my favorite aspects of every other song nearly perfectly. the lyrics might be considered corny but they are believable, expecially with how they are sung. it is hard to describe how incredible this songs when youre in the right mood. you just have to listen to it.</dd>
			<br> 
			<dt><strong>Kind of a Long Way Down : 4/10</strong></dt>
				<dd>this is just a boring listen, but it isn't hateable. it is just a worse version of Secret Lovers At the Heaven's Gate Ranch. the only saving grace is that is placed in a perfect place for a slower song but i would never go out of my way to listen to it. just forgettable</dd>
			<br>
			<dt><strong>Not Waving But Drowning : 7/10</strong></dt>
				<dd>this is a perfectly fine song. i wouldn't say it does anything particualry interesting. at least it is an enjoyable experience, not every song can hit absurdly hard.</dd>
			<br>
			<dt><strong>Destroy All Monsters : 7.5/10</strong></dt>
				<dd>for a long time i really neglected this song. im not sure why, while it isn't necessarily stand out it is still a great listen. it has a good flow, it has a similar energy to something id expect to hear form strictly ballroom. it has a similar bursting feeling, its very energizing in a very satisfiing way.</dd>
			<br>
			<dt><strong>To a Husband At War 10/10</strong></dt>
				<dd>the end of this album is killer. it is really devestating, and this is a perfect introduction. this song has the best lyrics of the whole album and the song works perfecting for it. the instrumental perfectly sets the mood and it is heart wretching to listen too. there could be no better set up to the end of this album. if you weren't in a solem mood before you would be now, and if you were sad before... unlucky</dd>
			<br>
			<dt><strong>Conversations With Dr.Suessicide 10/10</strong></dt>
				<dd>i was not lying, the end of this album is stacked. this song is just great. its on the same level as To a Husband At War story wise and it uses the emotional draw to its power, flawlessly flipping between desperate drawn out vocals, and the screaming. and the screaming is great, the best of the album. my words wont be able to describe the listen expierience like just hearing it. it is a must listen</dd>
			<br>
			<dt><strong>Secret Lovers At the Heaven's Gate Ranch : 9/10</strong></dt>
				<dd>this is a great ending to the album. its placement is only a detriment because of how good the songs before it were. it does serve and a good send off though. it is calm, simple, but still powerful. its a good come down, by the end it is perfect to just sit in silence and be sad or wahtever. nerd</dd>
