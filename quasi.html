	  <p class="dark" style="width:35%">Quasi started in 1993 after former spouses Sam Coomes and Janet Weiss' band Motorgoat dissolved. The duo's released a whole bunch of albums, and i'll try to review as many as possible. I really like this band, in my opinion they're pretty similar to the Ben Folds Five in their sound, but they're also pretty unique.</p>
