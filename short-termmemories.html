	  <p>Short-Term memories was released in 2000 as "The Salteens"'s first studio album under the record label "Endearing Records". All of the songs are pretty short, averaging at about 2 minutes.</p></div>

	     <dd>This one's alright. I like the usage of trumpets, and the drums are groovy. Not that much to write home about, but a little better than average. 6.5/10</dd>

	     <dd>This is probably one of my favorites on the album. When the distorted guitar kicks in it makes me really happy. I really appreciate how dynamic the song is overall.  7/10</dd>

	    <dt><strong>The Best Thought</strong></dt>
	     <dd>Compared to the other songs on the album, this song's pretty relaxed, which I'm not actually a huge fan of. I just wish there was a little more instrumental focus in the song. 5/10</dd>

	     <dd>This one's pretty good. I like the synth melody and the rhythm is pretty solid. </dd>

	     <dd>This song is how I found out about The Salteens. It's pretty simple chord progression-wise but I absolutely love the vocals and the harmonies created with the trumpet parts near the end. The drums are also pretty good. It sounds like it could've been turned into a generic pop song, but everything about it is just really well done, I only wish it was longer. 8/10</dd>
